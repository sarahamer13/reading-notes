## It's important to differentiate between CSS, HTML, and JavaScript when designing a website or a software or an application. We have to understand that each language is capable of doing something


### *Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?* ###

- It's important to use semantic elements in our HTML because those elements has meanings. Each element has a purpose. For example; when the user read the title of this question, he or she will find out that this is a heading to be specific an h1 element.

### *List 3 different types of comparison operators*

### *What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?* ###

- && — AND; allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that all of them have to individually evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true
