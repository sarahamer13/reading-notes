### *In the context of the reading “Pain and Suffering,” describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles* ###

- Python is a different language from Java. I believe as a beginner person the first thing to notice is the syntax is different from Java. It sounds like an English language, but more complicated than that. My two strategies for overcoming these obstacles is to get used to the new syntax and try to do as much practice as possible.


### *After reading “Beginners Guide to Big O,” explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity* ###

- Time complexity and space complexity are two important features in computer science according to the article. They are important to understand how an algorithm's performance scales with the input size. Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete by using usually Big O notation. It uses O(1) (constant time), O(n) (linear time), O(n^2) (quadratic time):, O(2^n) (exponential time)

- Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses and it also uses Big O notation


### *Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python* ###

- Mutable data are values that can be changes while immutable data are values that can't be changed.
