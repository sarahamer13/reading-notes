## In today's reading we get to learn that adding images and colors to the website can offer a better user experience. Also, it can make it more beautiful ##

### *What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?* ###

- Its value is supposed to be a textual description of the image, for use in situations where the image cannot be seen/displayed or takes a long time to render because of a slow internet connection

### *How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document* ###

- From an accessibility viewpoint, captions and alt text have distinct roles. Captions benefit even people who can see the image, whereas alt text provides the same functionality as an absent image. Therefore, captions and alt text shouldn't just say the same thing, because they both appear when the image is gone

### *Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document* ###

- A better solution, is to use the HTML < figure > and < figcaption > elements. These are created for exactly this purpose: to provide a semantic container for figures, and to clearly link the figure to the caption

### *Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community* ###

- SVG is an XML-based vector graphics format that specifies the contents of an image as a set of drawing commands that create shapes, lines, apply colors, filters, and so forth. SVG files are ideal for diagrams, icons, and other images which can be accurately drawn at any size. As such, SVG is popular for user interface elements in modern Web design

- GIF is a good choice for simple images and animations

### *What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?* ###

- Unless you're willing to compromise on quality, you should use a lossless format for screenshots. This is particularly important if there's any text in your screenshot, as text easily becomes fuzzy and unclear under lossy compression.

PNG is probably your best bet, but lossless WebP is arguably going to be better compressed.


### *Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge* ###

- At a fundamental level, the color property defines the foreground color of an HTML element's content and the background-color property defines the element's background color


### *What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?* ###

- Font is the most important element. You should consider what do you want to draw the visitor to, to the simplicity of the font or how beautiful a font can be

### *What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?* ###

- Font-size changes the size of the text. Font-weight can set how bold the text is. Font-style it affect a text's font, e.g., which font gets applied, its size, and whether it's bold, italic, etc.

### *Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element* ###

- You either alter the padding or add margins

### *Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?* ###

- I would ask him what color background he likes and ask if he wants a different font color
