## In today's reading we learn the importance of how webages should be user friendly and easy to read by utilizing CSS ##

### *To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?* ###

- By wrapping the text or other content inside an < a > element 

### *The href attribute contains what information?* ###

- The href attribute contains the web address (link)

### *What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?* ###

- By putting the link in a simple plain text, readers find link text helpful

### *What is meant by “normal flow”?* ###

- Normal flow is the way elements are laid out on a web page if no CSS has been applied to change the way they behave


### *What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?* ###

- By default, a block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and the element grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content. The size of inline elements is just the size of their content.

### *___ positioning is the default for every html element* ###

- Normal flow

### *Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element* ###

- An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow. Instead, it sits on its own layer separate from everything else. This is very useful: it means that we can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page. For example, popup information boxes, control menus, rollover panels, UI features that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page, and so on.

### *What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?* ###

- This works in exactly the same way as absolute positioning, with one key difference: whereas absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

### *Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation* ###

- Declaring a function is defining it and filling it with the information we want, while invoking a function is  simply allowing the function to run

### *What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?* ###

- Some functions require parameters to be specified when you are invoking them — these are values that need to be included inside the function parentheses, which it needs to do its job properly

### *Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey* ###

- Greater efficiency - Two people working on a code produce quality code. After all, the saying says ( two brains are better than one) When two people think, the possibilities are endless. Two people can research and resolve the code faster

- Engaged collaboration - When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone. It is harder to procrastinate or get off track when someone else is relying on you to complete the work. This certainly can hold each other accountable and keep track of each other's work
