# Git Introduction # 

## What is Git? ##

- *Snapshots*: Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots
- *Local Operations*: Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources
- *Tracking Changes*: Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git
- *States*: Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.

  * Committed:  It means data is securely stored in a local database

  * Modified:  It means the file has been changed but not committed to the database

  * Staged: Flagged a fileâ€™s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot

# Aspects of Version Control #

## What is Version Control? ##

- Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes.
- It can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes.
- Mistakes with files can easily be rectified

## Types of Version Control

1. ***Version Control*** It is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file

2. ***Centralized Version Control System*** It allow for collaboration on files within a team

3. ***Distributed Version Control systems or DVCS*** It allow clients to create multiple mirrored repositories. DVCS is important for when CVS goes down
