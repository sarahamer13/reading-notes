# Loops #

- Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly

- You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another

- There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times

- The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop

- Some statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:

1. Do... while statement : The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

2. While statment : A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true

3. For statment : A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false
