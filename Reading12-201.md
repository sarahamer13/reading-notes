## In today's reading  we learn the importance of using charts and how it's helpful in displaying data to the user ##

### *What does the < canvas > allow a developer to acheive?* ###

- HTML5 features the < canvas > element that allows you to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript.


### *What is the importance of the closing `< /canvas > tag?* ###

- The < canvas > element requires the closing tag </canvas >. Any content between the opening and closing tags is fallback content that will display only if the browser doesn’t support the < canvas > element

### *Explain what the getContext() method does* ###

- The < canvas > element features the getContext() method that returns a render context object.

### *What is Chart.js and how it can be brought into your project?* ###

- A great way to get started with charts is with Chart.js, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.

- Chart.js provides a set of frequently used chart types, plugins, and customization options

### *List 3 different Chart types you can create using Chart.js.* ###


- Line chart, bar chart, and pie chart

### *What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?* ###

- Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.


### *How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?* ###

- It would aid in presenting the data we collected through clicks and the number of times images was shown to the user in a clear way.
