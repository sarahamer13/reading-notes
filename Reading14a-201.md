- alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.

### *What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?* ###

- With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.
