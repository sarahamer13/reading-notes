*This is where I'm going to put my reading assignments.*

**Growth Mindset is I never give up and stay focused on the final outcome.**

**Reminders to stay in a growth mindset:**
1. Ask for help if you need to, you don't need to figure out everything on your own
2. Remember failure is only the beginning of success
3. Stay optimistic
