# My Reading Notes!

*This is where I'm going to put my reading assignments.*

**Growth Mindset is being open to embrace challanges and having strong desire to learn new ideas.**

**Reminders to stay in a growth mindset:**
1. Ask for help if you need to, you don't need to figure out everything on your own
2. Remember failure is only the beginning of success
3. Stay optimistic and remember the beginning is always hard, but for a good reason.
