# Understanding Markdown Syntax #

Markdown is the alternative lanaguge to HTML. It uses symploys to add pictures, headings, linkes, etc.

- One of my favorite things I learned is adding an image. You can add an image by adding the exclamation mark (!) and wrap the alternative text in bracketts [  ] Then add parentheses ( ) to the path of the image.
