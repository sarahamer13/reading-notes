# Understanding Markdown Syntax #

Markdown is the alternative lanaguge to HTML. It uses symbols to add pictures, headings, links, etc.

- One of my favorite things I learned is adding an image. You can add an **image** by adding the exclamation mark (!) and wrap the alternative text in brackets [  ] Then add parentheses ( ) to the path of the image.

- I have uploaded the picture to my github then I posted the link of the picture above.

### Links ### 
- You can add a link by wrapping the text in brackets [] then adding parentheses () the URL.
