## In today's reading we get to learn to focus on the importance of using HTML, and JS. They have  various uses and it can give us more control and flexibility when designing pages


### *When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?* ###


- The < ul > element is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless. Typically, unordered-list items are displayed with a bullet


### *How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?* ###

- It can be changed by using the list-style-type property through CSS.


### *When should you use an ordered list vs an unordered list in your HTML document?* ###

- The < ol > and < ul > elements both represent a list of items. They differ in that, with the < ol > element, the order is meaningful. To determine which one to use, try changing the order of the list items; if the meaning is changed, the < ol > element should be used, otherwise you can use < ul >.

### *Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?* ###

 *We can use the type attribute for example:*

- i for lowercase Roman numerals

- A for uppercase letters


### *Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?* ###

- The margin is an invisible space around your box. It pushes other elements away from the box. Margins can have positive or negative values. Setting a negative margin on one side of your box can cause it to overlap other things on the page. Whether you are using the standard or alternative box model, the margin is always added after the size of the visible box has been calculated.

- The padding sits between the border and the content area and is used to push the content away from the border. Unlike margins, you cannot have a negative padding. Any background applied to your element will display behind the padding.

- Going back to studying something new is the main idea in the story and the padding in this case is the family members who support me and the margin is all the cousins and friends who don't support the idea of going back, they are in this case the negatives values.


### *List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model* ###

- < span> , < strong > , < a > , and < em >

### *What data types can you store inside of an Array?* ###

- We can store different data types such as strings, objects, numbers, and arrays too

### *Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?* ###

- It is a valid array because it is possible to have an array within an array. You can access the values by doing console.log the name of the array


### *List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do* ###

- Assignment: x = f() meaning x = f()

- Addition assignment: x += f() meaning	x = x + f()

- Subtraction assignment: x -= f() meaning x = x - f()

- Multiplication assignment: x *= f() meaning x = x * f()

- Division assignment: x /= f() meaning	x = x / f()



### *Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why* ###

- The code would not evaluate because false is a boolean and the addition operator will not work for it.


### *Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program* ###

- We can use conditional statement to check if someone is over 18 years old.


### *Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript* ###

- We use a loop when we want a block of code to repeat itself a certain number of time. You can create a loop and choose how many times it can run for.
