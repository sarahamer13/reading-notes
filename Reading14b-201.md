## Psychological safety ##


### *What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?* ###

- No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. But to be fully present at work, to feel psychologically safe, we must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We canâ€™t be focused just on efficiency

- The best teams have members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.

- People will share crazy ideas and brainstorm better when they feel comfortable within their team. Having the space to share ideas and feeling without fear of recrimination is vital to feeling psychologically safe


### *Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety* ###

- I had similar issues to Julia in the article when she was on the first team. We were a team of 8 people; we had multiple issues starting with a lack of communication where some team members communicated and others doesn't. Some people on the team have formed a small group that lead to being friends outside of work, which I feel has created a great working environment because we were able to talk about anything personal with each other, yet when it came down to work, we focus on the job and try to help each other as much as we can. However; we had other team members who we tried to communicate with, but our efforts didn't go anywhere.

- We have asked the manager to interfere because the type of work we do is not individual work, all the team members get to work on the patient's case to ensure the patient gets his or her medication. After the meeting with the manager, and each employee expressed his/her feeling and what is going on in their personal lives, the team has become a cohesive team and things started to run smoothly. The ultimate goal was to come to work and not leave personal lives at home, then put on a work face.

### *What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?* ###

- Teams who operate with a high degree of psychological safety achieve better results, report higher job satisfaction, increase productivity, and make employees happier/ satisfied with their jobs. Eventually, it will create employees who are excited to come to work every day.
